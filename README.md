This is the binary distribution of the application. If you don't want
to build it from source, just take `protoview.fap` file and drop it into the
following Flipper Zero location:

    /ext/apps/Tools

The `ext` part means that we are in the SD card. So if you don't want
to use the Android (or other) application to upload the file,
you can just take out the SD card, insert it in your computer,
copy the fine into `apps/Tools`, and that's it.
